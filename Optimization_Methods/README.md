# CS573 - Optimization Methods Assignments

This repository contains assignments from the course CS573 - Optimization Methods, offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Crete during the Fall Semester 2023-2024.

## Course Description

This repository contains assignments and related materials for the CS573 - Optimization Methods course. The course covers various optimization techniques and algorithms used in computer science and engineering.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis

**Description:**

Assignment 1 focuses on applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze datasets. The assignment includes:

- Loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Implementing SVD to decompose matrices.
- Utilizing PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Analyzing principal components and their significance.
- Conducting nearest neighbor analysis in low-dimensional space.
- Visualizing data distributions and patterns.

For more details, refer to the [Assignment 1 PDF](HY573_ex1.pdf).

### Assignment 2: Regression with Missing Data

**Description:**

Assignment 2 provides a comprehensive study of regression analysis, starting with Least Squares Regression and extending to Lasso Regression with a focus on feature selection and regularization. It further explores the concept of matrix completion as a method to handle missing data in datasets.

The assignment includes:

- Implementing Least Squares Regression from scratch to understand the fundamentals of linear modeling.
- Developing a Lasso Regression model to incorporate L1 regularization for feature selection and model simplicity.
- Investigating the impact of missing data on model performance and exploring matrix completion as a solution.
- Re-evaluating the regression models after applying matrix completion to see the improvements in prediction accuracy.

For more details, refer to the [Assignment 2 PDF](HY573_ex2.pdf).
